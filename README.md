# Dollar Variance Watcher

**Welcome to Dollar Variance Watcher**. DVW is a demo app made by Alejandro with ‚ù§Ô∏è.

The objective of this exercise is to develop a graph showing the daily variation of the dollar, relative to the Chilean peso, for every year since 1999.

The chosen API was [mindicador.cl](https://mindicador.cl/), which delivers the price for a specified time range for the American dollar relative to the Chilean peso.

This app was created through Create Nuxt App to speed up development and follow the Nuxt team's recommended practices.

## üêõ Known Issues

- On mobile devices, viewing too large a range of years will crash the browser tab. This is most likely a performance issue with ChartJS - should be solved by rendering simpler charts or by reducing the amount of data points that are shown at once.
- GitHub CI workflows are not passing `build` step. There is an issue with `nuxtjs/eslint-module` not being found, not sure why. Works just fine in Netlify and local environment.
- In the `CurrencyService` test suite, the following test `Should retrieve all values from a range` is not passing. I need to investigate how to mock the implementation or resolved value of an inner method (maybe a Spy? Stub?).
